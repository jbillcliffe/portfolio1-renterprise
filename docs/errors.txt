1.
ERR - Select drop down on contact form kept grouping wrong for the "other countries", closing the group after the first option and leaving the rest ungrouped
FIX - First time using .getJSON, found it as a placement error for the appendTo() function. Also changed methodology to create the string as a whole and then
use appendTo(), functionality is then correct.

2.
ERR - WAVE report showed that original green colour (#2D8A60) was not providing enough contrast with the white text.
FIX - Swapped it for #1D5D40 which is a deeper green. This in turn meant redesign of the logo to incorporate the colour too

3. 
ERR - Logo as one size and a rectangle was becoming an issue.
FIX - Logo changed to a square, this makes scaling easier but also not a complicated change for CSS, as the background on the logo was the same as the background
colour of most elements in the web page.

4. 
ERR - Organising pattern/required for telephone is troublesome!
FIX - Removed from scope due to complexity in time scale. Would have lost a lot of time on a relatively small thing. So, it is a required text field and nothing more.
Doing a fixed pattern for UK phone numbers would have been a lot simpler with one pattern. But it would be optimal to have a saved pattern in JSON
for each country dialing code. I figure, that if people want to contact, they will really make sure they enter the right number!
