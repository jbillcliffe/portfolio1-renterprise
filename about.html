                        Initially designed as bespoke solution for a family business specialising in provision of
                        many different types of mobility equipment. <strong>Renterprise</strong> was initially unnamed
                        and highly specific.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Now <strong>Renterprise</strong> has evolved into a universal web based application. No longer
                        bound by the criteria of its predecessor and designed with the freedom to work with any product
                        or even service of your choosing.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Initally designed by one person (James Billcliffe), <strong>Renterprise</strong> was able to run
                        a national company, managing deliveries, assets, orders, customer relations and a tailor made
                        PCI DSS payments system including automated payments for weekly, bi-weekly, four-weekly and
                        monthly rentals.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        By the end of the life cycle of the first application, James became aware that being self taught
                        entirely had left some design and development practices which became too hard to work with and
                        to fix.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        It was from this, that <strong>Renterprise</strong> was born. The idea of software which was
                        scalable, flexible and reliable. But with the ability to be managed by individuals who may not
                        have the same level of computer accumen.
